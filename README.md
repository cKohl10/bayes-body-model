# bayes-body-model
Quantifying the distortions of body models with Bayesian inference.

# To Do
- Start with the wrist data.
- Use two model variants, one with a perfect spatial likelyhood and one with a perfect prior.
- Use a neural network to fit the skewed prior.

## Sources
The modeling is based on [3] and the experiemental data is from [1] and [2].
